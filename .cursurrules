# Component Guidelines

## UI Components
- All common UI widgets must be located in `lib/widgets/ui/` directory
- Widgets must be written as StatelessWidget or StatefulWidget
- File names must be in snake_case, class names in PascalCase
- Complex widgets should be separated into sub-widgets for reusability
- Basic UI style should be implemented based on minimal and modern Flat design like Toss app
- Maintain spacing (padding), simple colors, smooth animations, clear typography, and actively utilize Material 3 system
- Custom buttons, cards, section headers must be implemented based on internal common style guide

## Icons
- All icons must use the flutter_lucide package
- Package installation: `flutter pub add flutter_lucide`
- Icon import: `import 'package:flutter_lucide/flutter_lucide.dart'`
- Example: `Icon(LucideIcons.search), Icon(LucideIcons.menu)`

## Component Structure
- Page-specific widgets must be located in the corresponding route directory under `lib/screens/`
- Common logic should be organized in the `lib/components/` directory

## Best Practices
- Dart types must be explicitly specified
- Widgets should be designed for reusability
- When state is needed, separate into StatefulWidget and utilize setState or state management tools
- Recommend using package-based absolute paths over relative paths for imports
- Text styles, colors, spacing should maintain consistency through ThemeData, prioritizing styles set in global theme
